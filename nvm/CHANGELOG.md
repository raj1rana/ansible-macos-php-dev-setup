## [1.4.0] - 2019-11-03

### Known issues

The [lineinfile module crashes][ansible-63684] on Ansible 2.8.6 when trying
to update shell scripts.

The workaround is to use Ansible 2.8.5 until the fix is released or disable
shell script updates by setting `nvm_shell_init: false` in the role variables.

I've added a test for Ansible version that will fail if trying to run tasks
from `shell.yml` with Ansible 2.8.6.
